The index.php that you should have received along with this readme file is the code for pacificpelican.us/cms, a free web application written in PHP that can be used to upload files and shorten URLs.

If you did not receive the index.php file (along with the library directory and its files) you can download the app at this page:

Open the index.php file in a text editor and change the password from the default "ghana2014goal" to your choice, and check the configuration section to see if you need to make any changes to make the app work with your server configuration.

When your index.php file is ready, upload it to your directory that you want to use for your pacificpelican.us/cms installation.  It is best to install pacificpelican.us/cms at the root of your domain or subdomain if possible.  Then make sure to upload the library directory (with its files) to your directory.
